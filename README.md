# SwiftFoundationHelpers

A Swift package that includes an integrated collection of Swift Foundation extensions and related
custom abstractions.

## Overview

SwiftFoundationHelpers is a Swift package designed to complement Swift Foundation, Appleâ€™s native
framework for building Swift apps and packages.  It simplifies everyday coding tasks by extending
key Foundation types such as String, Date, Array, and more.

This package focuses on providing practical, reusable extensions and abstractions that:

* Simplify common patterns in Swift Foundation.
* Extend Swift Foundationâ€™s capabilities without overriding or replacing its native functionality.

By integrating SwiftFoundationHelpers into your project, you can reduce boilerplate code, improve
readability, and adopt reusable patterns tailored for modern Swift apps and packages.

## Features
